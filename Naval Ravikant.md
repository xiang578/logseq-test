Four kinds of luck

  + The first kind of luck is ^^blind luck^^ where one just gets lucky because something completely out of their control happened. This includes fortune, fate, etc.

    + 瞎猫碰上死耗子

  + Then, there’s luck through persistence, hard work, hustle, and motion. This is when you’re running around creating opportunities. You’re generating a lot of energy, you’re doing a lot to stir things up. It’s almost like mixing a petri dish or mixing a bunch of reagents and seeing what combines. You’re just generating enough force, hustle, and energy for luck to find you.

    + 努力和勤奋，产生足够多的机会，让运气找到你。

  + A third way is you become very good at spotting luck. If you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in your field, and other people who aren’t attuned to it won’t notice. So, you become sensitive to luck.

    + 善于发现运气，发现领域中其他人看不到的运气。

  + The last kind of luck is the weirdest, hardest kind, where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, which causes luck to find you.

    + 独特的符号，独一无二的品牌，非你莫属。

    + Naval 真是厉害，能把很深奥的道理用非常浅显的方式讲述。比如最核心的思想就是要 Productize youself，没错把自己当作产品来对待，这样就可以迭代，可以 sell，可以获得反馈。一下子把很多道理都串起来了。
