I began keeping a "procrastination journal" (sounds stupid, I know, but hear me out). Every time I caught myself procrastinating, I'd quickly jot down: #card
  + What I was supposed to be doing 我本应该在做的事情

  + What I was doing instead (usually scrolling Reddit or watching yt shorts) 我当时在做什么（通常是刷 Reddit 或看 YouTube 短视频）

  + How I was feeling in that moment 我当时的感觉



And then I would read it at the end of the day. At first, it felt pointless. But after a few weeks, I started noticing patterns.#card
  + Turns out, I wasn't just being "lazy" - I was avoiding specific types of tasks when I felt overwhelmed or unsure where to start. 不知道如何开始

  + I am a software dev who also do the product management at my company. And I hate doing "research" on features. 讨厌功能研究

The weird thing is, just being aware of these patterns made them easier to deal with.#card
  + When I know that if i had to do research, greater changes i won't be productive today.

  + And now Instead of beating myself up, I started break down the scary tasks into smaller chunks.
