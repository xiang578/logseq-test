## 总结
作者讲解自己定义的 Smart Note Blocks，光看她的解释是挺抽象的。例子在下一节课。
## Block types answer Three Questions #card
What will this Block type be used for?
When do I want to see this Block type (not individual) again?
How is this block type identified?
## General Blocks
### Life Note
WHAT:#card
A note about progress, thoughts, daily activities, etc...
WHEN:#card
I want to see these when I go back to review progress, analyze the effectiveness of my day, look back at my thoughts, etc..

These notes do not need to be tagged as they live on the DNP page.
### Task Note
WHAT:#card
A note that includes a specific task

All task notes get funneled through the [[X - Task Management]] process beginning with the tag of `Inbox`
### Project Note
WHAT:#card
A note that contributes to a project. Primarily an idea for content, or the content itself

No matter where these notes are taking, they are always either nested under the Project Page Name (nest tag), or added directly to the Project Page.
