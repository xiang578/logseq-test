Here's how a Zettelkasten works:
Write each idea you come across on a card
Link idea cards to other relevant idea cards (idea -> idea link)
Sort cards into broader topic boxes (idea -> topic link)
Literature notes
Add useful docs (papers, books) as a literature note
Metadata includes: literaturenote tag, source, author
Summarise content, each key idea as a simple sentence
Elaborate on each key idea with some bullet points

Permanent notes
写 Permanent notes 的两条标准
Would I explore this further?
Or can I connect this to other ideas?
Permanent notes 的 metadata
permanentnote tag
topic tags
Source，literature note link
relevant permanent notes and short explanation of how it is relevant
Add summary in prose

Topics
This comes free if you've been adding topic tags
You can now jump into topics via tags and navigate via links of relevant permanent notes
