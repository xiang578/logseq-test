如何选择处理 Inbox  [Triage strategies for maintaining inboxes (e.g. Inbox Zero) are often too brittle](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8aZybuJJopS5fL7TnPou2JcmCsBUJeqirbBh)

  + [[GTD]] 中经常强调 [[Inbox Zero]]

  + 至少做到内容增长率低于处理率

  + 推迟处理不重要的任务

  + "Zero-inbox appears to be his principle behind 5.1 and 5.3. The reading inbox is a triage area. The work is deciding whether to:

throw away

read seriously (ie, take notes)

read shallowly (add to references)

added to another list (eg, recipes)"
