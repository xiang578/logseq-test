This guide aims to help you create {{c1 understanding}} in the context of an informational resource like an article or talk.
By that I mean writing prompts not only to {{c5 durably internalize the overt knowledge}} presented {{c4 by the author}}, but also to {{c1 produce and reinforce understandings}} of {{c2 your own}}, understandings which you can {{c3 carry into your life and creative work.}}
The most common **mechanism** of change for spaced repetition learning tasks is called {{c1 retrieval practice}}.
In brief: when you attempt to {{c1 recall some knowledge from memory}}, the act of retrieval tends to {{c1 reinforce those memories.}}
The learning produced by retrieval is called the {{c1 [[testing effect]]}} because it occurs when you explicitly {{c1 test}} yourself, reaching within to recall some knowledge from the tangle of your mind.
retrieval practice is about testing your knowledge to {{c1 produce learning}}, rather than to {{c2 assess learning 评估}}.
[[e.g.]] What distinguishes retrieval practice from typical school tests? #card
Its purpose is to *produce* learning, not assess it.
[[e.g.]] In general, writing an SRS prompt amounts to giving your future self a recurring {{c1 task}}.
Properties of effective retrieval practice prompts
(This guide’s) properties of effective prompts: focused, precise, consistent, tractable, effortful
Precision: Vague questions will elicit {{c1 vague}} answers.
Focus: Prompts with too much detail tend to stimulate {{c1 incomplete}} retrievals.
When prompts produce inconsistent answers, what happens to the memories which aren’t retrieved? #card
They’re inhibited.
How often do spaced repetition systems expect you to be able to answer a given prompt in review sessions? #card
Almost always.
How does question scope impact spaced repetition scheduler efficiency? #card
Tightly-scoped prompts allow easy and difficult elements to be scheduled at different rates.
Why is it important that you can’t infer a prompt’s answer from the question? #card
Retrieval practice depends on **recalling the answer from memory.**
文章目的 So we must learn two skills to write effective retrieval practice prompts:
how to characterize exactly what knowledge we’ll reinforce, 准确描述要学习的知识
and how to ask questions which reinforce that knowledge. 增强知识
用挖空来练习回顾列表
If a focused prompt feels intractable, what text might you add to the question (parenthetical)? :->  A cue.
What must a prompt’s cue *not* do? #card
Allow you to infer the answer without recalling it.
可以给每一个空一些提示
[[elaborative encoding]]: information {{c1  easier to recall}} if you can {{c2 connect it to other memories}}
Interpretation; the “more than you think” rule of thumb
Writing good prompts often involves {{c1 interpretation}}: extracting information which isn’t explicitly written.
Prompt-writing rule of thumb: how many prompts should you write? #card
More than feels natural. 比自然感觉更多
What cognitive factor does the appropriate scale of a ‘focused’ prompt depend on? #card
The scale of the concepts you’ve internalized (aka ‘chunk size’)
Procedural   knowledge 程序化知识
Simple procedures can be mechanically translated into a single set of prompts by treating the steps like a {{c1 list}}.
To emphasize discrete details of procedures in prompts, what should you identify? 强调提示中程序的具体细节 #card
Keywords (important verbs, conditions, adjectives, adverbs, subjects, objects)
Procedures can often be broken down into keywords like this.
What are the important verbs,
and when should you move between them?
What are the key adjectives, adverbs, subjects, objects?
What stock is and why it matters: conceptual knowledge
(This guide’s) five lenses for writing **conceptual** prompts: #card
attributes and tendencies, similarities and differences, parts and wholes, causes and effects, significance and implications.
To write prompts about a concept’s attributes and tendencies, what should you identify about its instances? #card
What’s always / sometimes / never true.
To write conceptual prompts using the ‘parts and wholes’ lens, what kind of diagram is helpful to visualize? #card
A Venn diagram.
Write a prompt about types of shapes using the “similarities and differences” lens. (try to create a new one; change the concept if needed) #card
Q. How is a parallelogram like a square? / A. All four sides parallel
To write prompts about a concept’s {{c1 significance and implications}}, ask: why does that concept matter?
Significance and implications: write prompts which make the concept {{c1 personally meaningful.}}
Open lists
[[generation effect]] you remember information better when {{c1 you generated it yourself.}}
What’s the difference between an open list and a closed list? #card
Closed lists have a specific set of members;
open lists can grow over time.
Digital bookmarking metaphor for open lists :-> tags
What’s the common problem with writing only a ‘give an example’-type prompt for an open list? #card
You’ll usually end up remembering only one or two examples.
What distinguishes the task of a ‘creative prompt’ from that of a retrieval prompt? #card
You’re asked to give a new answer each time, not answer from memory.
Creative prompts are only possible when you’re able to {{c1 generate many different responses.}}
What knowledge does a creative prompt reinforce through retrieval practice? #card
Whatever you consistently use when generating new answers.
Salience prompts and the [[Baader-Meinhof phenomenon]] 显著性提示
new ideas are particularly salient, so we notice them more readily.
Selective attention: we’re more likely to notice occurrences of something when it’s highly {{c1 salient 显著的，突出的}}.
Without intervention, how does salience tend to change over time? 如果不进行干预，显著性会如何随时间变化 :-> Fades
To integrate new ideas into your life, it’s helpful to keep them salient until when? #card
You can use them or connect them to something meaningful in your experience.
[[Baader-Meinhof phenomenon]]: when you {{c2 hear something for the first time}} then {{c1 suddenly notice it everywhere}}
How might spaced repetition prompts relate to the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon? 间隔重复提示如何与巴德尔-迈因霍夫现象相关？ #card
Prompts can extend that phenomenon by keeping ideas salient over time.
提示可以通过在一段时间内保持想法的显著性来延续这一现象。
When possible, phrase salience prompts around contexts where {{c1 those ideas might be meaningful in your life.}}
Writing prompts, in practice
What simplifying goal can you adopt to make prompt-writing feel less onerous while reading? #card
Aim to write a small number of prompts on each pass through the text.
When writing prompts about ideas in a challenging text, which details does Andy suggest you initially focus on? #card
Basic details you can build on.
If you notice a feeling of completionism when writing prompts about a text, remind yourself that you {{c1 can always write more prompts later.}}
Why might you be able to write better prompts from a text when you return to it later? (a trigger) #card
Something meaningful might have motivated your return (a new connection, a problem, a gap)
Prompt-writing litmus tests: what’s a ‘false positive’? #card
You can produce the answer, but you don’t know the information you intend to know.
What false positive can arise when a prompt’s question includes unusual words or cues? #card
Pattern matching (knowing the answer by the shape of the question, without thinking about the words)
What should you do with binary prompts? (which ask yes/no or this/that) #card
Rephrase them as more open-ended prompts.
What prompt-writing problem is the most common cause of false negatives? #card
Not including enough context.
Retrieval practice prompts must unambiguously exclude {{c1 alternative correct answers.}}
Revising   prompts over time
What does Andy believe the most important thing to “optimize” in spaced repetition practice is? #card
Your emotional connection to review sessions and their contents.
您与复习课程及其内容的情感联系。
